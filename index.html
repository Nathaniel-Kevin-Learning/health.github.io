                    A full-stack developer is a professional who has the skills and expertise to work on both the front-end and back-end aspects of web development. This means they're proficient in building and maintaining both the client-side (what users interact with) and server-side (the behind-the-scenes operations) components of web applications.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Front-end development involves creating the user interface, designing the layout, and implementing features that users interact with directly using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Back-end development involves working on the server-side logic, managing databases, handling user authentication, and ensuring the overall functionality and performance of the application. This is done using languages like JavaScript (with Node.js), Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP, along with frameworks like Express.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring Boot, or Laravel.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Full-stack developers have a broad understanding of the entire web development process, from the user interface to the server-side logic, allowing them to create complete, end-to-end solutions. They can work independently or as part of a team to develop web applications from start to finish.
